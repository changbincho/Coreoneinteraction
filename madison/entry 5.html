        Around the reflecting pool, the park curves into a quiet ring. The water is dark enough to mirror the trees and buildings, so it feels like the city is doubled under the surface.

      <p id="paragraph2">
        You hear small sounds in layers: metal chairs scraping, low conversations, and the soft splash of water when the wind moves the plants in the middle.
