        In the evening, the main path feels like a quiet corridor. The lamps turn on under the trees, and a layer of yellow leaves spreads across the ground.
      </p>

      <p id="paragraph2">
        Most of the sound is soft—people talking in low voices on benches, the rustle of leaves when someone walks past, and distant traffic at the edge of the park.
